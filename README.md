# Customer Support Chatbot

This project is part of **Machine Learning Task 3** by Future Interns.  
I built a **customer support chatbot** using **Dialogflow**, a no-code chatbot builder by Google.

## Features
  Greeting message
  Handles FAQs such as:
  Order status ("Where is my order?")
  Refunds
  Shipping information
  Smart fallback when the bot doesnâ€™t understand

## Tools Used
  Dialogflow ES (Google Cloud)
  Machine Learning concepts: intent recognition, entity extraction
  Web Demo integration

## Live Demo
